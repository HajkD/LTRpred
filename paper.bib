              featured in the 2013 NAR Database Issue, contained 1143 families
              of repetitive elements found in humans, and was used to produce
              more than 100 Mb of additional annotation of TE-derived regions
              in the human genome, with improved speed. Here, we describe
              recent advances, most notably expansion to 4150 total families
              including a comprehensive set of known repeat families from four
              new organisms (mouse, zebrafish, fly and nematode). We describe

              software, HMMER3, have resulted in a 100-fold speed gain relative

              within a few seconds. Methods are available for searching either
              a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or
              profile HMM against a target sequence database, and for searching
              a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to
              cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch
              uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge
              multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing
              metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide
              sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely
              used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not
              publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily
              described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely
              available for academic use. METHODS: When searching nucleotide
              sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by
              the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify
              similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in
              USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment
              of the query against potential target sequences, using full
              dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used
              by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using
              vectorisation and multiple threads. RESULTS: VSEARCH includes
              most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in
              USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH
              version 8, including searching (exact or based on global
              alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting,
              abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection
              (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or
              prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting,
              and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file
              processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality
              statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH
              extends functionality with several new commands and improvements,
              including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity
              sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among
              different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format
              conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than
              USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection
              and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read
              merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing
              clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when
              performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is
              available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the
              BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version
              3.0. DISCUSSION: VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate
              and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source
              versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the
              metagenomics community.",

              identification tools determine the position of potential LTR

              further analysis, it is desirable to obtain an annotation of the

              LTRdigest, a novel software tool for automated annotation of
              internal features of putative LTR retrotransposons. It uses local

              retrotransposon-associated protein domains as well as primer
              binding sites and polypurine tracts. As an example, we used

  author   = "Ellinghaus, David and Kurtz, Stefan and Willhoeft, Ute",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Transposable elements are abundant in eukaryotic
              genomes and it is believed that they have a significant impact on
              the evolution of gene and chromosome structure. While there are
              several completed eukaryotic genome projects, there are only few
              high quality genome wide annotations of transposable elements.
              Therefore, there is a considerable demand for computational
              identification of transposable elements. LTR retrotransposons, an
              important subclass of transposable elements, are well suited for
              computational identification, as they contain long terminal
              repeats (LTRs). RESULTS: We have developed a software tool
              LTRharvest for the de novo detection of full length LTR
              retrotransposons in large sequence sets. LTRharvest efficiently
              delivers high quality annotations based on known LTR transposon
              features like length, distance, and sequence motifs. A quality
              validation of LTRharvest against a gold standard annotation for
              Saccharomyces cerevisae and Drosophila melanogaster shows a
              sensitivity of up to 90\% and 97\% and specificity of 100\% and
              72\%, respectively. This is comparable or slightly better than
              annotations for previous software tools. The main advantage of
              LTRharvest over previous tools is (a) its ability to efficiently
              handle large datasets from finished or unfinished genome
              projects, (b) its flexibility in incorporating known sequence
              features into the prediction, and (c) its availability as an open
              source software. CONCLUSION: LTRharvest is an efficient software
              tool delivering high quality annotation of LTR retrotransposons.
              It can, for example, process the largest human chromosome in
              approx. 8 minutes on a Linux PC with 4 GB of memory. Its
              flexibility and small space and run-time requirements makes
              LTRharvest a very competitive candidate for future LTR
              retrotransposon annotation projects. Moreover, the structured
              design and implementation and the availability as open source
              provides an excellent base for incorporating novel concepts to
              further improve prediction of LTR retrotransposons.",

              phenotypic variation that has been selected during domestication
              and breeding programs. In tomato, transpositions of the LTR (long

              various phenotypes of agronomical interest, such as fruit shape

              largely unknown. We have developed a bioinformatics pipeline for
              the functional annotation of retrotransposons containing LTRs and
              defined all full-length Rider elements in the tomato genome.
              Subsequently, we showed that accumulation of Rider transcripts
              and transposition intermediates in the form of extrachromosomal
              DNA is triggered by drought stress and relies on abscisic acid
              signalling. We provide evidence that residual activity of Rider
              is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms involving siRNAs and the
              RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway. Finally, we demonstrate
              the broad distribution of Rider-like elements in other plant

              Current evidence may suggest that recombinogenic retrotransposons

  abstract = "Retrotransposons have played an important role in the evolution

              composition of DNA sequences that have been fixed over
              evolutionary time2. Such studies provide important 'snapshots'
              reflecting the historical activities of transposons but do not
              predict current transposition potential. We previously reported
              sequence-independent retrotransposon trapping (SIRT) as a method
              that, by identification of extrachromosomal linear DNA (eclDNA),
              revealed the presence of active long terminal repeat (LTR)
              retrotransposons in Arabidopsis3. However, SIRT cannot be applied
              to large and transposon-rich genomes, as found in crop plants. We
              have developed an alternative approach named ALE-seq
              (amplification of LTR of eclDNAs followed by sequencing) for such
              situations. ALE-seq reveals sequences of 5' LTRs of eclDNAs after
              two-step amplification: in vitro transcription and subsequent
              reverse transcription. Using ALE-seq in rice, we detected eclDNAs
              for a novel Copia family LTR retrotransposon, Go-on, which is
              activated by heat stress. Sequencing of rice accessions revealed
              that Go-on has preferentially accumulated in Oryza sativa ssp.
              indica rice grown at higher temperatures. Furthermore, ALE-seq
              applied to tomato fruits identified a developmentally regulated
              Gypsy family of retrotransposons. A bioinformatic pipeline
              adapted for ALE-seq data analyses is used for the direct and
              reference-free annotation of new, active retroelements. This
              pipeline allows assessment of LTR retrotransposon activities in
              organisms for which genomic sequences and/or reference genomes
              are either unavailable or of low quality.",

  abstract = "Motivation: Retrieval and reproducible functional annotation of
              genomic data are crucial in biology. However, the current poor
              usability and transparency of retrieval methods hinders
              reproducibility. Here we present an open source R package,
              biomartr , which provides a comprehensive easy-to-use framework
              for automating data retrieval and functional annotation for
              meta-genomic approaches. The functions of biomartr achieve a high
              degree of clarity, transparency and reproducibility of analyses.
              Results: The biomartr package implements straightforward
              functions for bulk retrieval of all genomic data or data for
              selected genomes, proteomes, coding sequences and annotation
              files present in databases hosted by the National Center for
              Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and European Bioinformatics
              Institute (EMBL-EBI). In addition, biomartr communicates with the
              BioMart database for functional annotation of retrieved
              sequences. Comprehensive documentation of biomartr functions and
              five tutorial vignettes provide step-by-step instructions on how
              to use the package in a reproducible manner. Availability and

  author   = "Wang, Zhengming and Baulcombe, David",
  abstract = "Silencing of transposable elements (TEs) is established by small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Maintenance of silencing is then based on a combination of RdDM and RNA-independent mechanisms involving DNA methyltransferase MET1 and chromodomain DNA methyltransferases (CMTs). Involvement of RdDM, according to this model should decrease with TE age but here we show a different pattern in tomato and Arabidopsis. In these species the CMTs silence long terminal repeat (LTR) transposons in the distal chromatin that are younger than those affected by RdDM. To account for these findings we propose that, after establishment of primary RdDM as in the original model, there is an RNA-independent maintenance phase involving CMTs followed by secondary RdDM. This progression of epigenetic silencing in the gene-rich distal chromatin is likely to influence the transcriptome either in cis or in trans depending on whether the mechanisms are RNA-dependent or -independent.",

               transposition can be estimated by quantifying the accumulation of
               mutations in initially identical LTRs. This way, retrotransposons
               are divided into young, potentially mobile elements, and old that
               moved thousands or even millions of years ago. Both types are
               found within a single retrotransposon family and it is assumed
               that the old members will remain immobile and degenerate further.
               Here, we provide evidence in Arabidopsis that old members enter
               into replication/transposition cycles through high rates of
               intra-family recombination. The recombination occurs pairwise,
               resembling the formation of recombinant retroviruses. Thus, each

               chromosomally integrated LTR retrotransposons consisting of
               pairwise recombination products produced in a process comparable
